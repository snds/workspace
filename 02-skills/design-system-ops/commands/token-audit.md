Run the token-audit skill against the user's design system tokens.

Load the token-audit skill from 02-skills/design-system-ops/skills/token-audit/SKILL.md and follow its complete workflow.

If the user provided a file or directory path as an argument, use that as the token source: $ARGUMENTS

If no argument was provided, begin with Step 0 (Token discovery) — search the codebase for CSS custom properties, SCSS variables, JSON/YAML token files, Style Dictionary configs, TypeScript token objects, Tailwind configs, and Tokens Studio exports.

Before starting the audit, read the reference material specified in the skill's frontmatter from 02-skills/design-system-ops/skills/token-audit/references/.

Produce the full audit report including: three-tier assessment, naming violations, value-level violations, severity-rated findings, dependency map, and prioritised remediation list.

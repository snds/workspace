# SESSION-STATE — Mailbird, working name (24-mailbird)

_Last updated: 2026-10-14 — checkpoint (PRs #1–#8 merged; Phase 4b Microsoft in PR #9)_

## Current state (rewritten atomically — no stale fields)

### 🤝 Live handoff (the baton — any agent reads this FIRST)

- **TL;DR (for future agent)**: An open-source, ad-free PIM "super app" with mail, calendar,
  contacts, and notes. It is mobile-first and runs on the web plus Tauri shells. The code is in
  `snds/Mailbird`, and its docs/ folder holds the research, license audit, architecture, and ADRs.
- **Current focus**: Phase 4b Microsoft accounts, in review as PR #9 (`phase-4b-microsoft`). PRs #1–#8 are merged.
- **Working set**: `crates/core/src/net/{graph,graph_pim,oauth}.rs`, `crates/core/src/ical.rs` (`shape`),
  `crates/core/tests/graph.rs` (fake Graph + token server), `apps/web/src-tauri/src/{oauth_commands,workers}.rs`,
  `apps/web/src/features/oauth-sign-in.tsx`, `docs/decisions/0014-microsoft.md`, `docs/microsoft-setup.md`.
- **Last action**: Merged PR #8 (Sean confirmed after the fact), then built and verified Phase 4b (Microsoft):
  - Sign-in with a localhost redirect, answered on both loopback addresses; identity from /me.
  - Graph mail on the `RemoteBatch` contract: per-folder delta with immutable ids, MIME send, polling.
  - Outlook calendars and contacts translated to iCalendar and vCard behind the DAV contract (new `DavOutcome::Created`).
  - The fake Graph test caught three bugs, all fixed. Not yet tried against real Microsoft.
- **Next action**: Merge PR #9 only on Sean's explicit word (don't take "continue" as a merge), then Phase 5 (mobile).
  Sean must register a Google OAuth client and a Microsoft Entra app for real sign-ins (`docs/google-verification.md`, `docs/microsoft-setup.md`).
  Notes follow-ups: end-to-end encryption to the relay, images, linking from the note side, and export.
  Calendar follow-ups: free/busy, COUNTER, and missed-reminder catch-up.
- **Open decisions**: (1) the product name, which collides with Mailbird, Inc. (ADR-0006). Google verification is blocked on it;
  (2) the Tauri mobile spike vs Capacitor (ADR-0002); (3) when to subset the Material Symbols font
  (ADR-0003); (4) whether to keep Apache-2.0 for the repo license.
- **Blocked on**: nothing. No TLS round trip against a live provider has been tested yet, because
  cloud egress blocks it.
- **In-flight / do-not-touch**: none.
- **Agent thread**: Claude Opus 5.5 / Claude Code cloud (2026-10-13): research, Phase 0 (PR #1),
  Phase 1 (PR #2), Phase 1b (PR #3), Phase 1c (PR #4), Phase 2 (PR #5), Phase 2b (PR #6), Phase 3 (PR #7), Phase 4 (PR #8), all merged; Phase 4b (PR #9).

### Environment
- **Context profile**: `personal-solo` + `visibility: public`.
- **Code repo**: `github.com/snds/Mailbird` (default branch `main`).
- **Gotcha**: the Dovecot test server needs a short runtime path (unix sockets fail on long
  paths); `tools/test-mail-servers/start.sh` defaults to `/tmp/mbtest`.
- **Gotcha**: Stalwart 0.16 keeps its config in its database. `start-jmap.sh` drives the bootstrap API. The
  bootstrap admin is synthetic (its Email/query fails), so tests use a real `tester@localhost.test`.
  GitHub release downloads are blocked in cloud sessions, so the script builds from source.
- **Gotcha**: never `pkill -f <pattern>` from a shell whose own command line contains the pattern.
  Use `pgrep -x`.
- **Gotcha**: Sonner restores focus to the pre-toast element when a toast unmounts, which steals
  focus from a dialog opened by a toast action. The composer reclaims focus for its first second.
- **Gotcha**: Stalwart serves CalDAV/CardDAV on the same :8080 listener (`/.well-known/caldav` → `/dav/cal`), so the DAV test reuses `start-jmap.sh`.
- **Gotcha**: calcard pairs overrides with their series by SEQUENCE. Strip SEQUENCE before `expand_dates`, or a bumped override duplicates its occurrence.
- **Gotcha**: Hocuspocus allows one provider per document name per socket, and a destroyed provider's close can unsubscribe its replacement. Use `sessionAwareness: true`, and never pass `onSynced: undefined` (it replaces the default handler).
- **Gotcha**: never run `cargo fmt` here: the repo isn't rustfmt-formatted, and it rewrites every file. Format only new files, with `rustfmt --config max_width=180,use_small_heuristics=Max`.
- **Gotcha**: the cloud disk fills from `target/` (about 20 GB). Use `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, or delete `target/debug/incremental`.
- **Gotcha**: the shadcn registry host may be blocked by cloud network policy. Components come from
  a shadcn-ui/ui git clone through `tools/shadcn-material/transform.mjs`.

### VCS state
- `phase-4b-microsoft`: Phase 4b, in PR #9. `main` has Phases 0 through 4.
